If it's for other full facial coverage, we recommend choosing a shade closer to what you would use for foundation. We have customers who will buy two shades so they can go lighter and darker as they need to and use the two colors to blend. <br>\n      Here’s a video that should help you choose the perfectly color for you. <br>\n      <br>\n    <\/p>\n    <div style=\"text-align: center\"> \n      <!--                         <video height=\"400\" controls class=\"prd-det-vid-img\">\n                            <source src=\"images\/shades.mov\">\n                            Your browser does not support the video tag.\n                        <\/video> --> \n    <\/div>\n    <p><\/p>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"up-slide-dwn\">\n  <div class=\"accordion acdn-heading accordion-close\">How do you apply the concealer?<\/div>\n  <div class=\"acdn-content\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <p class=\"acdn-para\"> How you apply the concealer comes down to personal preference. The concealer itself is quite thick in order to provide maximum coverage so it’s best to let it warm up a little before spreading either on the back of your hand or between your fingers. <br>\n      <br>\n      Once warmed, most of our customers chose to use their fingers to dab it onto their skin, and then use the brush, their fingers, or a sponge to blend it. <\/p>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"up-slide-dwn\">\n  <div class=\"accordion acdn-heading accordion-close\">What are the ingredients in your products:<\/div>\n  <div class=\"acdn-content\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <p class=\"acdn-para\"> <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"ing-btn-concealer\">Concealer Ingredients<\/a> <br>\n      <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"ing-btn-neck-cream\">Neck Cream Ingredients<\/a> <br>\n      <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"ing-btn-powder\">Finishing Powder Ingredients<\/a> <br>\n      <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"ing-btn-apple\">Apple Stem Cell Cream Ingredients<\/a> <br>\n      <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"ing-btn-citrus\">Citrus Stem C Serum Ingredients<\/a> <\/p>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"up-slide-dwn\">\n  <div class=\"accordion acdn-heading accordion-close\">What is the undertone of each concealer shade?<\/div>\n  <div class=\"acdn-content\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <p class=\"acdn-para\"> Light - fair cool<br>\n      Neutral beige - neutral<br>\n      Medium - warm<br>\n      Deep - warm<br>\n      Dark - cool<br>\n    <\/p>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"up-slide-dwn\">\n  <div class=\"accordion acdn-heading accordion-close\">How long does a tube of concealer last?<\/div>\n  <div class=\"acdn-content\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <p class=\"acdn-para\">It depends on the individual, as some of our customers will use it primarily as a concealer, while others use it as foundation.
