      <h4>DATA ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING</h4>
      <ol class="scrollToText">
        <li>
          <h4>Data Analytics</h4>
          <p>We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics (including Google Signals, Google User-ID, and other Google Analytics features) and MixPanel) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices to better tailor services and features; and provide certain features to you.  If you have a Google account with personalized advertising enabled, through Google Signals, Google will also be able to gather for us analytics and engagement information from across the various devices you use to access the Services. To prevent Google from using your information for analytics (including cross-device tracking for personalization purposes), you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>. And to opt out of Google Signals, please open your “Settings” app, locate and tap “Google,” select “Ads,” and turn ON “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”  You may also be able to disable cross-device tracking through your Android or Apple device-based settings.</p>

          <p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Online Advertising</h4>
          <p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Facebook, Google Ad Words, Criteo and others) that use cookies and other technologies to deliver relevant content and advertising for products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services.</p>

          <p>We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>

          <p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third-party advertising network services. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">link</a>, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">link</a>, or the Your Online Choices <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">link</a></p>

            <p>Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Mobile Advertising</h4>
            <p>When using mobile applications from us or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>

Accordingly, please take care when using these features.</p>
        <p><i>Aggregate/De-Identified Information</i>. We reserve the right to create Aggregate/De-Identified Data from the information we collect through the services and our sharing of such Aggregate/De-Identified Data is in our sole discretion.</p>

        <h4 id="THIRDPARTYLINKSANDCONTENT">THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND CONTENT</h4>
        <p>The Website and email messages that you receive from Fièra Cosmetics may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third parties. Fièra Cosmetics is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. Fièra Cosmetics does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such third-party websites. The inclusion of a link to a website does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.</p>

        <h4 id="DATASECURITY">DATA SECURITY</h4>
        <p>The Website and email messages that you receive from Fièra Cosmetics may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third parties. Fièra Cosmetics is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. Fièra Cosmetics does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such third-party websites. The inclusion of a link to a website does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.</p>

        <h4 id="SUBMITTINGINFOFROMOUTSIDETHEUS">SUBMITTING INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</h4>
        <p>We control and operate the online and mobile resources from within the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Information collected through the Website and Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our vendors maintain facilities. Although we do not actively block or monitor visitors from other countries, the Website is directed only at visitors from the U.S. As such, this Privacy Policy is consistent with U.S. law and practice and is not adapted to other laws (including European data security and privacy laws). Fièra Cosmetics will apply the applicable laws of the U.S. including as embodied in this Privacy Policy in place of data protections under your home country's law. That is, you freely and unambiguously acknowledge that this Privacy Policy, not your home country's laws, controls how we will collect, store, process, and transfer your personal information. Similarly, the English language version of this Privacy Policy is the controlling version regardless of any translation you may attempt.</p>

        <h4 id="DATAPRIVACYANDPROTECTIONLAWSCCPAGDPR">DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION LAWS: THE CCPA AND GDPR</h4>
        <p>Privacy and data protection laws vary around the world and among the several United States. Some of those laws are more specific than others. Most prominently, residents of California and data subjects whose personal information was obtained from them while they were in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland have certain additional rights in cases where the party collecting that information is governed by the applicable law. We have reviewed our business operations and data-related business practices with legal counsel in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation under European Law also known as the “GDPR” and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). As a result of that review, as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we do not believe we are governed by either the GDPR or CCPA.</p>

        <p>We do not, for instance, collect personal information from data subjects in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland or elsewhere abroad. Similarly, we do not target or tailor our Website or Services or any of our other US-based business activities to appeal to, or specifically attempt to do business in those jurisdictions. In terms of California, although we may do business within the state, we do not meet any of the various statutory thresholds and criteria that would bring us under the CCPA.</p>

        <p>For general visitors, consumers and regulators who have questions about whether or how the GDPR, CCPA or other industry- or jurisdiction-specific laws apply to us, you can contact us using the contact information below. </p>

        <h4 id="CHILDRENSPRIVACY">CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
        <p>Federal law imposes special restrictions and obligations on commercial website operators who direct their operations toward, and collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take those age-related requirements very seriously, and, consistent with them, do not intend for our Website or Services to be used by children under the age of 18, and certainly not by anyone under the age of 13. Moreover, we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information to us via our Website or Services, we will delete that information and not use it for any purpose whatsoever. We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk with their children about the potential risks of providing personal information over the Internet.</p>

        <h4 id="CHANGESTOTHISPRIVACYSTATEMENT">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
        <p>We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check our Website periodically for such changes since all information collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection. Typically, we will indicate the effective/amendment date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If we feel it is appropriate, or if the law requires, we’ll also provide a summary of changes we’ve made near the end of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
