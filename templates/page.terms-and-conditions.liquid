              <h4>General</h4>
              <p>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a “Claim” without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Fièra Cosmetics, or any involved third-party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with Fièra Cosmetics, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Fièra Cosmetics or any third-party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Fièra Cosmetics, or any involved third-party may pursue a Claim. Fièra Cosmetics agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against Fièra Cosmetics. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. You further agree that all claims must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, only individual relief is available, and that claims of more than one customer cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) a representative action for public injunctive relief pursuant to California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.) and/or False Advertising Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 et seq.) must be arbitrated on a class basis, (b) in the event that the foregoing clause is deemed invalid or unenforceable, a representative action for public injunctive relief pursuant to California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.) and/or False Advertising Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 et seq.) may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Buffalo, New York on a class basis, and (c) any claims other than for public injunctive relief must be arbitrated on an individual, non-class basis as otherwise set forth in this Section.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Exceptions</h4>
              <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and Fièra Cosmetics both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. Fièra Cosmetics will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court.</p>

              <p>The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Buffalo, New York: (i) an action by Fièra Cosmetics relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by Fièra Cosmetics for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection “b” in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection “b,” the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Buffalo, New York, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</p>
              
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Required Pre-Dispute Procedures</h4>
              <p>Before initiating any Claim against us, you agree to first contact us with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by U.S. Mail to Fièra Cosmetics Inc., Attn: Legal Department, P.O. Box 3335 Buffalo, NY 14240-3335. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Commencing Arbitration</h4>
              <p>You and Fièra Cosmetics agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Arbitration Location</h4>
              <p>If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in Buffalo, New York unless Fièra Cosmetics otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator</h4>
              <p>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection “b” above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection “d” above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Fièra Cosmetics.</p>
